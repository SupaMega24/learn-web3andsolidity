If you are like me, you have been struggling with where to start learning Solidity. I'll admit it, I'm about three weeks in and just now starting to feel like I'm heading in the right direction. There are numerous resources available for the eager learner, making it challenging for noobs like myself to pick a starting point. In this post, I'll discuss the ones that I have settled on. I'm a noob! I'm not perfect, but I'm moving forward day by day.

### **Choosing a Foundation Language:**

One of the first challenges I faced (and still climbing out of) was what language to start with and build a foundation before moving to my ultimate goal of mastering Solidity. After countless hours of Reddit comments digging into my sleep time, I was convinced that Python was the right choice for me. I even made 3 YouTube videos to showcase what I'd learnt. You can check those out below (PS - I'm not a YouTuber, but I did the best I could as a noob).

Python is indeed a nice language to learn from. However, as I've come to know more about coding and web3 I realize that JavaScript may be more in line with my goals. So, I took some time to learn the basics. I'll just have to pick up the rest as I go. I can tell you this, it is an adventure and you will get dizzy and frustrated. However, the time I spent is not lost as the learning is transferable.

### **Organizing my Syllabus (Learning Plan)**

I've decided to start my journey with the following platforms and programs.

* CryptoZombies
    
* Ethernaut
    
* Alchemy University
    
    * Ethereum Developer Bootcamp
        
    * Road to web3
        
* Hackathons and Continual Learning
    
    * Contribute to Open-source Projects - strengthen GitHub portfolio
        
    * learnweb3.io - courses and articles
        
    * buildspace.so - build your own idea events
        

Throughout this journey I will post what I have learned and go through it. I know that this is an excellent way to actually understand what is happening in the code. If I just go through the lessons without any time to reflect and break them down, I will not truly learn. If I am going to be a good developer, I'll need to understand what is happening with my work. Alright, enough gibber-jabber. Let's get learning!
