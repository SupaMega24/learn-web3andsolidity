# learn-web3andsolidity
This is where I document my journey as a beginner learning web3

Organizing my Syllabus (Learning Plan)

I've decided to start my journey with the following platforms and programs.

- CryptoZombies

- Ethernaut

- Alchemy University

  - Ethereum Developer Bootcamp

  - Road to web3

- Hackathons and Continual Learning

- Contribute to Open-source Projects - strengthen GitHub portfolio

- learnweb3.io - courses and articles

- buildspace.so - build your own idea events

Throughout this journey I will post what I have learned and go through it. I know that this is an excellent way to actually understand what is happening in the code. If I just go through the lessons without any time to reflect and break them down, I will not truly learn. If I am going to be a good developer, I'll need to understand what is happening with my work. Alright, enough gibber-jabber. Let's get learning!
